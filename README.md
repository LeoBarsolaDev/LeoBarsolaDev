<h2>📝 About me</h2>
<p>
  I'm a self-taught web developer. I became interested in the world of software development at the age of 15.
Since then, I've been learning and growing in this field, and now, at 23, I feel ready to take the next step in my professional journey.

With two years of freelance experience developing video games and websites, I believe it's time to join a larger project and be part of a team — a place where I can continue learning and growing even more.
